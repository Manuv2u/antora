----
xref:component-name::page-name.adoc[Link Text]
----
NOTE: You don’t need to specify any version, component name or module name while referencing the page in the same module under same component.

=== Using Partials
Partials are files which contain reusable snippets of content. Partials are stored under the partials directory under the same module. Partials and the page where it’s used are usually stored in the same module. However, the partials can be used in any pages in the documentation.

[source, text]
----

 include::version@component:module:partial$name-of-file.adoc[optional attributes]

----
|===
|Syntax|Description

|include|Directive

|version|Name of the version. The value is defined in the antora-playbook.yml file.

|component|Name of the destination component followed directly by a colon(:)

|module|Name of the destination module followed directly by a colon(:)

|partial$|keyword

|name-of-file.adoc|Partial filename

|[optional attributes]|level offset & tags
|===

- *Include a partial from the same module*.
----
 include::partial$login.adoc[]
----

- If the partial file to be included in the page belongs to the same module, simply type the include directive followed by (::), and then partial$ followed by the partial filename.

- *Include a partial from different module*.
----
 include::module-name:partial$login.adoc[]
----
- If the partials to be included in the page is present in a different module under the same component, use the above command.


- *Include a partial from another component*.
----
 include::component-name::partial$login.adoc[]
----
When the partial file and the page file belongs to different components, enter the partial’s component followed by the module, partial$ and the partial filename. If you don’t specify any version, it renders the latest stable version of the component. If you want a particular version, include the version before the component name. Also, if the component name is present and the module is ROOT, you can leave the module name field blank. That’s the reason the component name is followed by (::)
----
 include::1.0@component-name::partial$login.adoc[]
----
It includes the partial file in the page for the component version 1.0.

=== Add an image
Syntax :
----
image::relative-path-to-image-file[optional alt text]
----
Example :
----
image::Lenovo/-desktop-launch.png[Launch Desktop]
----
In the above example, ood-desktop-launch.png is in the path images/ondemand/ood-desktop-launch.png. Specify the local path of the image file relative to the module’s images directory which you want to include in the page.

IMPORTANT: A module’s image files must be stored in the images folder.

=== Other useful snippets

Sections partition a page into a content hierarchy and are defined using section titles.
----

=== Include  Tables

=== quote and verse paragraph styles

The optional attribution and citetitle attributes (positional attributes 2 and 3) specify the author and source respectively.

The verse style retains the line breaks, for example:

[verse, William Blake, from Auguries of Innocence]
To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.

=== Admonition Paragraphs

TIP, NOTE, IMPORTANT, WARNING and CAUTION admonishment paragraph styles are generated by placing NOTE:, TIP:, IMPORTANT:, WARNING: or CAUTION: as the first word of the paragraph. For example: +

[source]
---
NOTE: This is an example note.
or
[NOTE]
This is an example note.

---

Output

NOTE: This is an example note.
[NOTE]
This is an example note.
