= Why choose Istio?


Istio pioneered the concept of a sidecar-based service mesh when it launched in 2017. Out of the gate, the project included the features that would come to define a service mesh, including standards-based mutual TLS for zero-trust networking, smart traffic routing, and observability through metrics, logs and tracing.

An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.

- The **data plane** is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars. These proxies mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

- The **control plane** manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.

The following diagram shows the different components that make up each plane:
