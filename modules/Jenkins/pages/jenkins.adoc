== Q2. What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purposes. Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

== Q3. Define the process of Jenkins.

First, a developer commits the code to the source code repository. Meanwhile, the Jenkins server checks the repository at regular intervals for changes.
Soon after a commit occurs, the Jenkins server detects the changes that have occurred in the source code repository. Jenkins will pull those changes and will start preparing a new build.
If the build fails, then the concerned team will be notified.
If the build is successful, then Jenkins deploys the build in the test server.
After testing, Jenkins generates feedback and then notifies the developers about the build and test results.
It will continue to check the source code repository for changes made in the source code and the whole process keeps on repeating.

== Q4. What are the benefits of using Jenkins?

At the integration stage, you can cache build failures.
For each change in the source code, you generate an automatic build report notification.
To notify developers about build report success or failure, Jenkins integrates with the LDAP mail server.
Achieves continuous integration agile development and test driven development.
With simple steps, you can automate the Maven release project.
Easy tracking of bugs at an early stage in a development environment than production.

== Q5. What are the pre-requisites for using Jenkins?


To use Jenkins you require:

A source code repository which is accessible, for instance, a Git repository.
A working build script, e.g., a Maven script, checked into the repository.

== Q6. What is the relation between Hudson and Jenkins?


Hudson was the earlier name and version of current Jenkins. After some issues, they renamed the project from Hudson to Jenkins.

== Q7. How do you install Jenkins?

To install Jenkins, you just need to follow these five steps:

Install Java Version 8 – Jenkins is a Java based application, hence Java is a must.
Install Apache Tomcat Version 9 – Tomcat is essential to deploy Jenkins war file.
Download Jenkins war File – This war is must to install Jenkins.
Deploy Jenkins war File – You deploy Jenkins war file using Tomcat to run Jenkins.
Install Suggested Plugins – Install a list of plugins suggested by Jenkins.
Once the installation is complete, you will be able to see the Jenkins dashboard.

== Q8. Mention some of the useful plugins in Jenkins

Below I have mentioned some important Plugins:

Maven 2 project
Git
Amazon EC2
HTML publisher
Copy artifact
Join
Green Balls
These Plugins I feel are the most useful plugins, if you want to include any other Plugin that is not mentioned above, you can add that as well, but make sure you first mention the above-stated plugins and then add your own.

== Q9. What are the two components that you can integrate Jenkins with?

According to me, the integration of Jenkins is possible with the following:

Version Control system like GIT, SVN.
Build tools like Apache Maven.
If you have anything else in your mind then mention that as well but make sure you include the above two components in your answer.

== Q10. What is Maven? What is the benefit of integrating Maven with Jenkins?

Maven is a build management tool. It uses a simple pom.xml to configure all the dependencies needed to build, test and run the code. Maven manages the full lifecycle of a test project. Once integrated with Jenkins, the Maven Webdriver will build the project and execute all tests efficiently.

== Q11. Mention what are the commands you can use to start Jenkins manually.

To start Jenkins manually open Console/Command line, then go to your Jenkins installation directory. Over there you can use the below commands:

Start Jenkins: jenkins.exe start
Stop Jenkins: jenkins.exe stop
Restart Jenkins: jenkins.exe restart

Here are some of the Source Code Management tools supported by Jenkins:

AccuRev
CVS
Subversion
Git
Mercurial
Perforce
Clearcase
RTC

== Q13. How will you define Post in Jenkins?

Post is a section that contains several additional steps that might execute after the completion of the pipeline. The execution of all the steps within the condition block depends upon the completion status of the pipeline. The condition block includes the following conditions – changed success, always, failure, unstable, and aborted.

== Q14. What are Parameters in Jenkins?

Parameters are supported by Agent section and they are used to support various use-cases pipelines. Parameters are defined at the top-level of the pipeline or inside an individual stage directive.

== Q15. What is Groovy?

Groovy from Apache is a language designed for the Java platform. It is the native scripting language for Jenkins. Groovy-based plugins enhance Jenkins with great interfaces and build reports that are of dynamic and consistent nature.

== Q16. How Can You Clone A Git Repository Via Jenkins?

If you want to clone a Git repository via Jenkins, you have to enter the e-mail and user name for your Jenkins system. Switch into your job directory and execute the “git config” command for that.

== Q17. How to create a backup and copy files in Jenkins?

To create a backup all you need to do is to periodically back up your JENKINS_HOME directory. This contains all of your build jobs configurations, your slave node configurations, and your build history. To create a back-up of your Jenkins setup, just copy this directory. You can also copy a job directory to clone or replicate a job or rename the directory.

== Q18. Explain how you can set up Jenkins job.

My approach to this answer will be to first mention how to create Jenkins job. Go to Jenkins top page, select “New Job”, then choose “Build a free-style software project”. Now you can tell the elements of this freestyle job:

Optional SCM, such as CVS or Subversion where your source code resides.
Optional triggers to control when Jenkins will perform builds.
Some sort of build script that performs the build (ant, maven, shell script, batch file, etc.) where the real work happens.
Optional steps to collect information out of the build, such as archiving the artifacts and/or recording javadoc and test results.
Optional steps to notify other people/systems with the build result, such as sending e-mails, IMs, updating issue tracker, etc..

== Q19. How will you secure Jenkins?

The way I secure Jenkins is mentioned below if you have any other way to do it then mention that:

Make sure that the global security is on.
Check if Jenkins is integrated with my company’s user directory with an appropriate plugin.
Ensure that the matrix/Project matrix is enabled to fine-tune access.
Automate the process of setting rights/privileges in Jenkins with custom version controlled script.
Limit physical access to Jenkins data/folders.
Periodically run security audits on the same.

== Q20. Explain how you can deploy a custom build of a core plugin?

Below are the steps to deploy a custom build of a core plugin:

Stop Jenkins.
Copy the custom HPI to $Jenkins_Home/plugins.
Delete the previously expanded plugin directory.
Make an empty file called <plugin>.hpi.pinned.
Start Jenkins.

== Q21. What you do when you see a broken build for your project in Jenkins?

There can be multiple answers to this question I will approach this task in the following way:

I will open the console output for the broken build and try to see if any file changes were missed. If I am unable to find the issue that way, then I will clean and update my local workspace to replicate the problem on my local and try to solve it. If you do it in a different way then just mention that in your answer.

== Q22. What are the various ways in which a build can be scheduled in Jenkins?

You can schedule a build in Jenkins in the following ways:
* By source code management commits
* After completion of other builds
* Can be scheduled to run at a specified time (cron)
* Manual Build Requests

== Q23. What is the use of Pipelines in Jenkins?

The Pipeline plugin in Jenkins allows you to define your build process as a script, known as a Jenkinsfile. This script can model complex Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows, enabling teams to manage and visualize the stages and tasks involved in their software delivery pipeline. Pipelines are durable, can be paused for human approval, and support parallel execution, making them suitable for handling sophisticated CD requirements.

== Q24. Explain the terms Agent, post-section, Jenkinsfile

*Agent*: This directive in a Jenkinsfile specifies where and how Jenkins should execute the pipeline. It defines the environment in which the stages of the pipeline will run.

*Post-section*: This section allows you to define actions that should be executed after all stages of the pipeline have completed, regardless of success or failure. It is used for tasks like notifications, archiving artifacts, or cleaning up resources.

*Jenkinsfile*: This is a text file that resides in your source code repository and contains the definition of your Jenkins Pipeline. It defines the stages, steps, and configuration of your pipeline, enabling reproducible builds and deployments.

== Q25. Do you know about cloud computing? How can Jenkins fit into a cloud computing environment? Explain with an example.

Cloud computing services like AWS utilize CI/CD practices to deliver software updates and features rapidly to their customers. Jenkins automates the CI/CD pipelines, integrating with cloud services such as Amazon EC2 or ECS. For example, Jenkins can dynamically spin up EC2 instances, deploy applications, run tests, and manage infrastructure as code through plugins and scripts, ensuring efficient and scalable software delivery in the cloud.

== Q26. What is Kubernetes? How can you integrate Jenkins with Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Jenkins integrates with Kubernetes using plugins like Kubernetes Plugin or Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin. This integration allows Jenkins to dynamically provision Kubernetes pods as build agents, deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters, and manage containerized workflows efficiently.

== Q27. Have you run automated tests on Jenkins? How is it done?

Yes, automated tests can be executed on Jenkins using tools like Selenium for web application testing or Maven for Java projects. Developers configure Jenkins jobs to run these tests automatically upon code commits or scheduled builds. Jenkins displays test results in the build console output and generates detailed reports, notifying developers of test failures or successes.

== Q28. Let's say the first job in your pipeline was successful, but the second failed. What should you do next?

To handle this scenario in Jenkins, you can use the "restart from stage" feature. This allows you to restart the pipeline execution from the stage where it failed, ensuring that subsequent stages are re-executed based on the corrected input or conditions.

== Q29. What is the use of JENKINS_HOME directory?

The JENKINS_HOME directory is the location where Jenkins stores all its configuration settings, build logs, job configurations, plugins, and other critical data. It is essential for backing up and restoring Jenkins configurations and ensuring the stability and continuity of your Jenkins instance.

== Q30. What is a backup plugin? Why is it used?

A backup plugin in Jenkins is a tool that allows users to automate the process of backing up their JENKINS_HOME directory. It captures all configurations, jobs, build histories, and settings, enabling administrators to restore Jenkins instances quickly in case of system failures or data loss. Backup plugins are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of Jenkins environments.

== Q31. What is a trigger? Give an example of how the repository is polled when a new commit is detected.

In Jenkins, triggers are mechanisms that define when a build should be automatically started. For instance, when integrated with a source code management (SCM) tool like Git, Jenkins can poll the repository at specified intervals (e.g., every minute) to detect new commits. When a new commit is detected, Jenkins triggers a build job automatically, initiating the build process and executing defined tasks such as compilation, testing, and deployment.

== Q32. How do you define parameters for a build in Jenkins?

Parameters in Jenkins allow you to customize build jobs based on user input or predefined values. You can define parameters such as strings, booleans, files, or custom types directly in your Jenkins job configuration. These parameters can be used within build scripts, allowing users to specify runtime options or configurations dynamically when triggering builds.

== Q33. How does Jenkins authenticate users?

Jenkins supports several authentication mechanisms to authenticate users:
* Internal Database: Jenkins has an internal user database where user credentials and permissions are stored.
* Application Server Authentication: Jenkins can delegate authentication to the application server on which it is deployed, leveraging existing user management systems.
* LDAP Integration: Jenkins can authenticate users against an external LDAP server, enabling centralized user management and single sign-on capabilities.

== Q34. What are the ways to configure a Jenkins node agent to communicate with the Jenkins master?

To configure a Jenkins node (agent) to communicate with the Jenkins master, you can use two primary methods:
* Browser (Java Web Start): Launch the node agent using a Java Web Start (JNLP) file downloaded from the Jenkins master. This file establishes a communication channel between the node and master for executing build jobs.
* Command-line (Executable Agent JAR): Start the node agent from the command line using an executable agent JAR file provided by Jenkins. This method is useful for headless environments or automated provisioning of Jenkins build agents.

== Q35. How can you use a third-party tool in Jenkins?

To use a third-party tool in Jenkins, follow these steps:
1. Install the third-party software required for your build or deployment process.
2. Install the corresponding Jenkins plugin that integrates with the third-party tool.
3. Configure the third-party tool settings in the Jenkins administrative console, providing necessary credentials or parameters.
4. Use the installed plugin within your Jenkins build jobs or pipelines to invoke actions or operations supported by the third-party tool.

== Q36. What are the types of pipelines in Jenkins?

Jenkins supports three types of pipelines:
1. CI/CD Pipeline (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery): End-to-end pipelines that automate the entire software delivery process from code commit to production deployment.
2. Scripted Pipeline: Pipelines defined using Groovy-based scripts, allowing flexibility and advanced customization of build processes.
3. Declarative Pipeline: Pipelines defined using a simpler, structured syntax that focuses on defining stages, steps, and post-actions in a declarative manner, ideal for straightforward CI/CD workflows.

== Q37. What syntax does Jenkins use to schedule build jobs or SCM polling?

Jenkins uses cron syntax to schedule build jobs or poll SCM repositories at specified intervals. The cron syntax consists of five fields separated by spaces, representing minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week. For example, scheduling a build job every Monday at 11:59 PM would be expressed as `59 23 * * 1`.

== Q38. What is DevOps, and in which stage does Jenkins fit in?

DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. Jenkins fits into the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) stages of DevOps by automating build, test, and deployment processes. It enables teams to integrate code changes frequently, validate them through automated tests, and deliver reliable software releases rapidly and consistently.

== Q39. Do you know any other Continuous Integration tools? How is Jenkins better than any of those?

There are several other Continuous Integration tools besides Jenkins, such as TeamCity, Bamboo, CircleCI, and Travis CI. Jenkins is preferred by many organizations due to its open-source nature, extensive plugin ecosystem, and flexibility in building custom CI/CD pipelines. It supports a wide range of programming languages, integrates seamlessly with popular DevOps tools and cloud platforms, and offers robust community support and continuous improvement through contributions from a global developer community.

== Q40. Name a Jenkins environment variable you have used in a shell script or batch file.

Jenkins provides several environment variables that can be used within build scripts or pipelines. Some commonly used Jenkins environment variables include:
* $JOB_NAME: Name of the Jenkins job being executed.
* $NODE_NAME: Name of the agent node executing the Jenkins job.
* $WORKSPACE: Path to the workspace directory where the build is performed.
* $BUILD_URL: URL of the Jenkins build page for the current job.
* $JOB_URL: URL of the Jenkins job page for the current build.

These variables are dynamically populated by Jenkins during the build execution, providing context and metadata that can be utilized for automation and reporting purposes.

== Q41. What is Continuous Integration in Jenkins?

Continuous Integration (CI) in Jenkins refers to the practice of automatically integrating and testing code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository multiple times a day. Jenkins automates the build and testing of applications in a CI environment, ensuring that new code changes are validated and integrated quickly and efficiently. CI helps teams detect and resolve integration issues early, improve code quality, and accelerate the delivery of software updates and features to end-users.

== Q42. How do you achieve Continuous Integration using Jenkins?

To achieve Continuous Integration (CI) using Jenkins, follow these steps:
* Developers commit their code changes to a shared version control repository, such as Git.
* Jenkins monitors the repository for new commits and triggers automated builds whenever changes are detected.
* Jenkins pulls the latest code, compiles it, runs automated tests, and generates build artifacts.
* The build results, including test reports and code coverage metrics, are provided to developers for review and validation.
* Once validated, the built application can be deployed to staging or production environments using automated deployment pipelines, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery.

== Q43. What is DSL in Jenkins?

DSL (Domain Specific Language) in Jenkins refers to the Job DSL plugin, which allows users to define Jenkins jobs using a Groovy-based scripting language. With DSL, users can automate the creation and configuration of Jenkins jobs, pipelines, and views, making it easier to manage and maintain complex CI/CD workflows as code. DSL scripts are stored alongside source code in version control, enabling reproducible and consistent job configurations across Jenkins instances.

== Q44. How do you create a Multibranch Pipeline in Jenkins?

To create a Multibranch Pipeline in Jenkins, follow these steps:
* Create a new Jenkins project and select the Multibranch Pipeline project type.
* Configure the project to scan a specific repository branch or set of branches in the source code repository (e.g., Git or SVN).
* Jenkins automatically detects and creates separate Jenkinsfiles for each branch that contains a Jenkinsfile in the repository.
* Define build stages, steps, and post-actions in each Jenkinsfile to automate the CI/CD process for different branches.
* Jenkins manages and executes Pipelines for each branch independently, providing visibility and control over branch-specific builds and deployments.

== Q45. What are the types of jobs or projects in Jenkins?

Jenkins supports various types of jobs or projects, each catering to specific requirements and workflows:
* Freestyle project: Traditional Jenkins job allowing flexible configuration of build steps and actions.
* Maven project: Jenkins job configured to build and manage Java projects using Apache Maven.

Continuous Testing is the practice of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with changes in the application. It extends and enhances test automation to address the complexity and pace of modern software development and delivery. Continuous Testing ensures that tests are run continuously and seamlessly integrated into the DevOps process, providing early detection of defects, validating requirements, and ensuring the quality of software releases throughout the development lifecycle.

== Q48. Explain how you can move or copy Jenkins from one server to another?

To move or copy Jenkins from one server to another, you can follow these steps:
* Copy the entire JENKINS_HOME directory from the existing Jenkins server to the new server. The JENKINS_HOME directory contains all Jenkins configurations, jobs, plugins, and settings.
* Ensure that the new server meets the system requirements and dependencies for running Jenkins.
* Install Jenkins on the new server if it is not already installed.
* Start Jenkins on the new server and verify that all configurations and jobs are correctly migrated.
* Update DNS records or reconfigure Jenkins URLs if necessary to reflect the new server location and ensure seamless access for users and automated processes.

This migration approach ensures minimal downtime and preserves the integrity of Jenkins configurations and data during the server transition.

plugin is used in Jenkins for making the Jenkins Pipeline, which gives us the view of stages or tasks to perform one after the other in the pipeline form. It models a series of related tasks. Pipelines help the teams to review, edit and iterate upon the tasks. Pipelines are durable and it can optionally stop and wait for human approval as well to start the next task. A pipeline is extensible and can perform work that has been defined inside of an additional user-defined code.
