  -  Network Troubleshooting: It provides detailed information about network interfaces, which is essential for diagnosing connectivity issues, monitoring network traffic, and checking interface statuses.
  -  Interface Management: Users can enable or disable network interfaces, which is crucial for managing network connections and controlling which interfaces are active.
  -  MAC Address Modification: ifconfig enables users to change the MAC address of a network interface, which can be useful for security purposes or bypassing network restrictions.
  -  Temporary Network Changes: It allows for temporary network configuration changes without editing configuration files, useful for testing and troubleshooting.

== How to Find Your IP Address in Linux Using `ifconfig Command

ifconfig (interface configuration) command is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. It is used at the boot time to set up the interfaces as necessary. After that, it is usually used when needed during debugging or when you need system tuning. Also, this command is used to assign the IP address and netmask to an interface or to enable or disable a given interface.

Syntax of `ifconfig`Command in Linux
----
ifconfig [interface] [options]
----
Where:

  -  [interface] is the network interface you want to configure or display information for (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
 -   [options] are various command-line options that can be used to modify the behavior of ifconfig.

Newer versions of some Linux distributions don’t have ifconfig command pre-installed. So, in case, there is an error “ifconfig: command not found”, Then execute the following command to install ifconfig.

=== Installing net-tools in Linux

For Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions.
----
sudo apt-get install net-tools
----

=== What is Public and Private IP in Linux

In the realm of networking, both in Linux and other operating systems, IP addresses are categorized as either public or private. These designations are crucial for facilitating communication between devices on a network, whether it’s the global internet or a local intranet. Let’s delve into the distinctions between public and private IP addresses in Linux.

==== 1) How to Find Your Public IP Addresses in Linux

A public IP address is a globally unique identifier assigned to a device on the internet. It serves as the address by which other devices on the internet can find and communicate with it. Public IP addresses are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other organizations that control access to the global internet.

In Linux, you can determine the public IP address of a system by using external services or commands like curl or wget to query a web service. For example:
----
curl ifconfig.me
----
This command retrieves your public IP address from a web service.

Public IP addresses are essential for servers, websites, and other devices that need to be directly accessible from the internet. They are globally routable, meaning they can be reached from any location on the internet.

*Different Ways to Find Your Public IP Address in Linux*

==== 1) Using `wget` with `ifconfig.me` to Find Your IP Address in Linux

Similar to curl, this uses the ifconfig.me service to fetch your public IP address.
----
wget -qO- ifconfig.me
----


==== 2) Using `dig` with `resolver1.opendns.com` to Find Your IP Address in Linux

This command uses the OpenDNS resolver to query your public IP address.
----
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com

----

=== 3) Using `curl` with `icanhazip.com`to Find Your IP Address in Linux

This command queries the icanhazip.com service to obtain your public IP address.
----
curl icanhazip.com
----


==== 4) Using `wget` with `icanhazip.com` to Find Your IP Address in Linux

Similar to the curl command, this uses the icanhazip.com service to fetch your public IP address.
----
wget -qO- icanhazip.com
----


==== 5) Using host with dns.google to Find Your IP Address in Linux

This command utilizes the DNS service provided by Google to resolve your public IP address.
----
host myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com
----

=== 2) How to Find Your Private IP Addresses in Linux:

Contrastingly, private IP addresses are used within a private network and are not directly accessible from the internet. These addresses are defined in reserved address ranges specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 1918. The commonly used private IP address ranges are:

  -  10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
  -  172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
  -  192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)

These addresses are intended for use in local networks, such as home or corporate intranets. Devices within the same private network can communicate with each other using these private IP addresses, but they rely on a mechanism called Network Address Translation (NAT) to access the internet through a shared public IP address.

In Linux, you can view the private IP addresses of your system using the ifconfig or ip addr commands. For example:

----
ifconfig

or

ip addr
----
*Different Ways to Find Your Private IP Address in Linux*

==== 1) Using `hostname` to Find Your IP Address in Linux

The -I option with the hostname command can be used to display the private IP address of your machine.
----
hostname -I
----


==== 2) Using `nmcli` (NetworkManager command-line tool) to Find Your IP Address in Linux

If you’re using NetworkManager, this command filters out IPv4 addresses associated with your network interfaces.
----
nmcli dev show | grep IP4.ADDRESS
----


==== 3) Using `awk` with `ifconfig` to Find Your IP Address in Linux

This command uses the awk tool to filter and print only the private IP addresses from the ifconfig output.
----
ifconfig | awk '/inet / {print $2}'
----


==== 4) Using `grep` with `ip` to Find Your IP Address in Linux

This command uses grep with Perl-compatible regular expressions to extract private IP addresses from the ip command output.
----
ip addr show | grep -oP 'inet \K[\d.]+'
----


==== 5) Using `ss` (socket statistics) command to Find Your IP Address in Linux

This complex command lists the IP addresses to which the system is listening for incoming connections.
----
ss -tunapl | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u
----
