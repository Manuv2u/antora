= Maven - QA

== Q1. What is Maven?
Maven is a popular open-source build tool developed by the Apache Group to build, publish, and deploy projects. It simplifies project management tasks for Java-based projects.

== Q2. What does Maven help with?
Apache Maven manages processes like building, documentation, releasing, and distribution. It automates project builds and handles dependencies.

== Q3. What elements does Maven take care of?
Maven manages builds, dependencies, reports, distribution, releases, and mailing lists in project management.

== Q4. What is the difference between ANT and Maven?
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Q4.1. ANT | Q4.2. Maven
| ANT uses build.xml for configuration. | Maven uses pom.xml and follows conventions.
| ANT is procedural. | Maven is declarative.
| ANT lacks a lifecycle. | Maven has a defined lifecycle.
| ANT scripts are less reusable. | Maven plugins offer reusable project management.
| ANT is a specific build tool. | Maven is a comprehensive project management tool.
|===

== Q5. What is POM?
Project Object Model (POM) is an XML file in the project root directory that defines project configuration and metadata.

== Q6. What is included in the POM?
The POM includes dependencies, developers, contributors, plugins, plugin configurations, and resources.

== Q7. What are the minimum required elements for POM?
The minimum required elements are groupId, artifactId, version, and modelVersion (which should be 4.0.0).

== Q8. What is a Build Tool?
A build tool automates tasks like source code generation, compilation, packaging, and deployment.

== Q9. Steps to install Maven on Windows?
Download Maven, set JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME environment variables, add Maven to PATH, and verify with `mvn -version`.

== Q10. Steps to install Maven on Ubuntu?
Install Java, download Maven, configure environment variables, and verify installation with `mvn -version`.

== Q11. Command to install JAR files in the Local Repository?
Use `mvn install` to install JAR files into the local Maven repository.

== Q12. How to check the version of Maven being used?
Execute `mvn -version` to display the installed Maven version.

== Q13. What is Clean, Default, and Site in Maven?
Maven has built-in lifecycles:
- Clean: Deletes build files.
- Default: Handles project deployment.
- Site: Generates project site documentation.

== Q14. What is a Maven Repository?
Maven repositories store packaged JAR files and their metadata, facilitating dependency management.

== Q15. What are the different types of Maven Repositories?
Maven has Local, Remote, and Central repositories for managing project dependencies.

== Q16. What is Maven Build Lifecycle?
Maven Build Lifecycle defines a sequence of phases (e.g., clean, deploy) to manage project builds.

== Q17. How does Maven Architecture work?
Maven reads pom.xml, downloads dependencies, and executes lifecycle phases, goals, and plugins.

== Q18. What are the different phases in the Maven Build Lifecycle?
Maven Build Lifecycle phases include:
- Validate
- Compile
- Test
- Package
- Verify
- Install
- Deploy

== Q19. Command to build a Maven site?
Use `mvn site` to generate a Maven project site.

== Q20. Conventions used in naming a project in Maven?
Projects are named as `<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>` (e.g., `org.apache.maven:maven-core:2.0.1`).

== Q21. What is a Maven Artifact?
A Maven Artifact is a deployable component, typically a JAR file, identified by groupId, artifactId, and version.

== Q22. Phases of a Clean Lifecycle?
Clean Lifecycle includes pre-clean, clean, and post-clean phases.

== Q23. Phases of a Site Lifecycle?
Site Lifecycle phases include pre-site, site, post-site, and site-deploy.

== Q24. What are Maven Plugins?
Maven Plugins extend Maven's capabilities, performing tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging.

== Q25. Why are Maven Plugins used?
Maven Plugins automate common tasks like generating JAR files, compiling code, and creating documentation.

== Q26. Types of Maven Plugins?
Maven Plugins include build plugins (configured in `<build/>` element) and reporting plugins (configured in `<reporting/>` element).

== Q27. Why does Maven use "convention over configuration"?
Maven's conventions reduce the need for configuration by providing default project structures and build processes.

== Q28. Difference between Convention and Configuration in Maven?
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Convention | Configuration
| Maven provides default settings and structures. | Configuration requires explicit setup and details.
| Maven simplifies project setup and build. | Configuration involves specifying every detail.
|===

== Q29. Maven's order of inheritance?
Maven settings inherit from settings, CLI parameters, parent POM, and project POM.

== Q30. Build Life Cycles and phases in Maven?
Build Lifecycles consist of phases, each containing goals executed in sequence to build and manage projects.

== Q31. What is a Goal in Maven?
A Goal is a specific task or target executed during a Maven Build Lifecycle phase.

== Q32. Dependencies and Repositories in Maven?
Dependencies are Java libraries needed by a project. Repositories are directories storing packaged JAR files and their metadata.

== Q33. What is a Snapshot in Maven?
A Snapshot is a version in Maven's remote repository indicating the latest development copy.

== Q34. Types of projects in Maven?
Maven provides templates for various Java projects (e.g., Spring, Spring MVC) to simplify project setup.

== Q35. What is a Maven Archetype?
Maven Archetype is a template plugin for generating project structures based on predefined templates.

== Q36. Command to create a new project based on an archetype?
Use `mvn archetype:generate` to create a new Maven project based on an archetype.

== Q37. What does "Maven Clean" imply?
Maven Clean plugin removes generated files and directories (e.g., target folder) from the project.

== Q38. What is a Build Profile?
A Build Profile provides different configurations for building projects, enabling customization for different environments.

== Q39. Types of Build Profiles?
Build Profiles can be defined per-project (in pom.xml), per-user (in settings.xml), or globally (in global settings.xml).

== Q40. What is a System Dependency?
A System Dependency in Maven is a dependency with a system scope, typically provided by the JDK or VM.

== Q41. Why use Optional Dependencies?
Optional Dependencies reduce the transitive burden of libraries that are not always required for a project.

== Q42. Dependency Scope types?
Dependency Scope includes compile, provided, runtime, test, system, and import scopes in Maven.

== Q43. Transitive Dependency in Maven?
Transitive Dependency means Maven automatically includes dependencies needed by other dependencies.

== Q44. Activating Maven Build Profile?
Maven Build Profiles can be activated through command-line input, settings, environment variables, OS settings, or file conditions.

== Q45. Dependency Exclusion in Maven?
Dependency Exclusion in Maven excludes transitive dependencies to prevent conflicts or unwanted dependencies.

== Q46. What is MOJO in Maven?
MOJO (Maven Plain Old Java Object) is an executable goal in Maven, distributed via plugins to extend Maven's functionality.

== Q47. Command to create a new project based on an archetype?
Use `mvn archetype:create` to create a new Maven project based on an archetype.

== Q48. What does "Super POM" imply?
Super POM refers to the default POM in Maven, providing default configurations and settings for Maven projects.

== Q49. What is the Maven settings.xml file?
Maven settings.xml file contains configurations for Maven execution, including proxy settings, repository configurations, and more.

== Q50. Where are Maven dependencies stored?
Maven dependencies, including JAR files, are stored in the Maven local repository on the local system.

== Q51. What is the difference between mvn install and mvn deploy?
- `mvn install`: Installs the project artifacts into the local repository.
- `mvn deploy`: Deploys the project artifacts into the remote repository.
