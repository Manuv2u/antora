== 1. What is Maven?
Maven is a popular open-source build tool developed by the Apache Group to build, publish, and deploy several projects. It simplifies the day-to-day work of Java developers by managing dependencies and providing a uniform build system.

== 2. What does Maven help with?
Maven helps manage various project processes including building, documentation, releasing, and distribution. It automates project builds, manages dependencies, and enhances project performance.

== 3. What are the different elements that Maven takes care of?
Maven manages:
- Builds
- Dependencies
- Reports
- Distribution
- Releases
- Mailing lists

== 4. What is the difference between ANT and Maven?
|===
| ANT | Maven
| No formal conventions | Conventions (e.g., project structure defined in pom.xml)
| Procedural | Declarative
| No life cycle | Life cycle (clean, default, site)
| Not reusable scripts | Reusable plugins
| Specifically a build tool | Project management tool
|===

== 5. What is POM?
Project Object Model (POM) is an XML file that contains project information and configuration details. It resides in the project's root directory and defines the project's structure.

== 6. What all is included in the POM?
POM includes:
- Dependencies
- Developers and contributors
- Plugins

- Resources

== 7. What are the minimum required elements for POM?
The minimum required elements for POM are:
- project root
- modelVersion (should be 4.0.0)
- groupId (project’s group id)
- artifactId (artifact/project id)
- version (version of the artifact)

== 8. What is meant by the term ‘Build Tool’?
A build tool automates the process of compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying software applications. Maven is a build tool used primarily for Java projects.

== 9. What are the steps to install Maven on Windows?
To install Maven on Windows:
1. Download Maven and extract it.
2. Set JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME environment variables.
3. Add Maven's bin directory to the PATH environment variable.
4. Verify the installation using `mvn -version` command.

== 10. What are the steps to install Maven on Ubuntu?

4. Verify the installation using `mvn -version` command.

== 11. What is the command to install JAR files in the Local Repository?
To install JAR files in the local repository:
- Use `mvn install` command.
- Alternatively, use `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path to file>` to install manually.

== 12. How do you know the version of Maven being used?
To check the version of Maven:
- Use `mvn -version` command in the command prompt.

== 13. What is Clean, Default, and Site in Maven?
There are three built-in build life cycles in Maven:
- Clean: Cleans the project.
- Default: Handles project deployment.
- Site: Generates the project’s site documentation.

== 14. What is a Maven Repository?
Maven repositories are directories containing packaged JAR files along with their metadata (POM files). There are three types:
1. Local Repository
2. Remote Repository
3. Central Repository

== 15. What are the different types of Maven Repositories?
There are three types of Maven repositories:
- Local Repository: Stores project dependencies locally.
- Remote Repository: Hosted on servers, used for downloading dependencies.
- Central Repository: Default repository used by Maven for dependencies.

== 16. What is Maven Build Lifecycle?
Maven build lifecycle is a sequence of phases that define the order of goals to be executed to build a project.

== 17. How does Maven Architecture work?
Maven architecture operates in three steps:
1. Read the pom.xml file.
2. Download dependencies from remote repositories to the local repository.
3. Execute build lifecycle phases, goals, and plugins as defined.

== 18. What are the different phases in the Maven Build Lifecycle?
The Maven build lifecycle consists of different phases or stages such as:

[cols="2*"]
|===
| Clean Lifecycle | Site Lifecycle
| Pre-clean | Pre-site
| Clean | Site
| Post-clean | Post-site
| | Site-deploy
|===

== 19. Which command is used to build a Maven site?
To build a Maven site, use `mvn site` command. By default, the site is generated in `target/site/`.

== 20. What are the different conventions used while naming a project in Maven?
Maven project naming convention: `<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`. For example: `org.apache.maven:maven:2.0.1`.

== 21. What is a Maven Artifact?
A Maven artifact is a file (usually a JAR) that is deployed to a Maven repository. It is identified by its groupID, artifactID, and version.

== 22. What are the phases of a Clean Lifecycle?
Phases of the clean lifecycle include:
- Pre-clean
- Clean
- Post-clean

== 23. What are the phases of a Site Lifecycle?
Phases of the site lifecycle include:
- Pre-site
- Site
- Post-site
- Site-deploy

== 24. What is meant by Maven Plugins?
Maven plugins are extensions that provide custom build logic and reuse across projects. They execute tasks like compiling code, testing, packaging, and generating reports.

== 25. Why are Maven Plugins used?
Maven plugins are used to automate tasks such as:
- Creating JARs and WARs
- Compiling source code
- Unit testing
- Generating project documentation
- Creating project reports

== 26. What are the types of Maven Plugins?
There are two types of Maven plugins:
- Build plugins: Executed during the build process.
- Reporting plugins: Executed during the report generation phase.

== 27. Why is it said that “Maven uses convention over configuration”?
Maven promotes convention over configuration by providing default configurations and project structures. Developers only need to configure exceptions rather than every detail.

== 28. What is the difference between Convention and Configuration in Maven?
|===
| Convention | Configuration
| Maven defines default behaviors and project structures. | Requires explicit configuration of all details.
| Simplifies project setup and management. | Requires detailed configuration for each aspect.
|===

== 29. What is Maven’s order of inheritance?
Maven’s order of inheritance:
1. Settings
2. CLI parameters
3. Parent POM
4. Project POM

== 30. What do Build Life Cycles and phases imply in the basic concepts of Maven?
Build life cycles consist of phases, which in turn consist of goals. Phases define the sequence of goals to be executed in the build process.

== 31. What is the ‘Goal’ in Maven terminology?
A goal is a specific task that contributes to building and managing a project. Phases in the build life cycle define the order in which goals are executed.

== 32. What is meant by the term ‘Dependencies and Repositories’ in Maven?
Dependencies are external libraries required for a project. Repositories are directories containing packaged JAR files and their metadata, used for downloading dependencies.

== 33. What is a ‘Snapshot’ in Maven?
A Snapshot is a version of an artifact that indicates it is under active development. Maven checks for updated snapshots in remote repositories during builds.

== 34. What types of projects are available in Maven?
Maven provides thousands of project templates (archetypes) for various frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, etc., simplifying project setup.

== 35. What is a Maven Archetype?
A Maven Archetype is a template used by the `mvn archetype:generate` command to create new Maven projects with predefined structures and configurations.

== 36. What is the command to create a new project based on an archetype?
To create a new project based on an archetype, use `mvn archetype:generate` command in the terminal.

== 37. What does ‘Maven Clean’ imply?
`mvn clean` is used to clean the build artifacts generated by Maven. It removes the `target` directory containing compiled classes, JAR files, and other build artifacts.

== 38. What is a Build Profile?
A Build Profile in Maven is a set of configuration values that can be used to customize builds for different environments or purposes.

== 39. What are the different types of Build Profiles?
There are three types of Build Profiles in Maven:
- Project-specific (defined in pom.xml)
- User-specific (defined in settings.xml)
- Global (defined in Maven global settings.xml)

== 40. What is meant by the term ‘System Dependency’?
System dependencies in Maven are dependencies with the `system` scope that are provided by the JDK or VM, not managed by Maven.

== 41. What is the reason for using an Optional Dependency?
Optional dependencies reduce the transitive burden of libraries not always needed, improving project performance and reducing unnecessary dependencies.

== 42. What is the ‘Dependency Scope’, and how many types of Dependency Scopes are there?
Dependency Scope in Maven defines when and how dependencies are available during different stages of the build process.
The types of Dependency Scopes are:
- Compile
- Provided
- Runtime
- Test
- System
- Import

== 43. What is meant by ‘Transitive Dependency’ in Maven?
Transitive Dependency in Maven means if X depends on Y and Y depends on Z, then X transitively depends on Z as well. Maven manages transitive dependencies automatically.

== 44. How can a Maven Build Profile be activated?
Maven Build Profiles can be activated explicitly via command line options, Maven settings, environment variables, OS settings, or file presence/absence.

== 45. What is meant by ‘Dependency Exclusion’?
Dependency Exclusion in Maven allows excluding transitive dependencies. If X depends on Y, and Y depends on Z, then X can exclude Z from its dependencies.

== 46. What is MOJO?
MOJO (Maven plain Old Java Object) is a Maven plugin's executable goal represented by a Java class. Plugins distribute MOJOs to extend Maven's functionality.

== 47. What is the command to create a new project based on an archetype?
Use `mvn archetype:generate` command to create a new Maven project based on an archetype. It interacts with the user to generate project files and configurations.

== 48. What is meant by the term ‘Super POM’?
Super POM (Project Object Model) is the default POM in Maven that defines default configurations inherited by all Maven projects unless overridden. It simplifies POM configuration.

== 49. What is the Maven settings.xml file?
The Maven settings.xml file configures Maven execution with settings such as:
- Proxy configuration
- Local repository path
- Remote repository URLs
- Central repository settings

== 50. Where are Maven dependencies stored?
Maven dependencies, including JAR files and artifacts, are stored in the local repository on the developer's machine. Maven downloads dependencies from remote repositories to the local repository when needed.

== 51. What is the difference between `mvn install` and `mvn deploy`?
|===
| `mvn install` | `mvn deploy`
| Installs the project artifact in the local repository. | Deploys the project artifact to a remote repository or server.
| Copies the artifact to the local repository for local use. | Transfers the artifact to a remote repository for broader use.
